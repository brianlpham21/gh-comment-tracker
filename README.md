### The Challenge

Given a JSON file of pull requests comments in a fake GitHub repository, generate a visualization that provides valuable insight about the team and its developers.

The fake data to visualize is stored in `prComments.json`. Each pull request comment includes when it was written, who it was written by and on which pull request. `commentTopic` is the overall theme of the comment content, while `commentType` is the intention of the comment.

### Requirements

Please include all of the following when building your app.

-   Use React to build client app
-   Answer questions below

### Bonus

-   Create wireframes of your visualization (i.e. using figma)
-   Add filters to your visualization
-   Make the web app responsive
-   Make the web app hosted and publically accessible
-   Use Redux for state management

### Questions


-   What other visualization/insight would you like to provide given all of the data available on GitHub/Slack/Jira?
